<!-- JS and the DOM -->

<!-- 
	READ THIS FIRST!

This file is an HTML file. You'll put your JS code for the exercises in a <scipt> tag at the bottom of this file.
Open this file in Google Chrome by opening Chrome, typing command-O, and selecting this file.
Or in Chrome you can use the menu bar by doing File -> Open.
As you add JS code to the file, you can refresh the page and see your code take effect.
You can also type your JS code in the Console tab of Chrome Developer Tools to see it take effect.

Note: Usually you would put your HTML and JS in separate files, but for simplicity we're 
putting them in the same file for this exercise.

Read through the HTML code given, then scroll down to the exercises below.
Type your JavaScript code for each exercise below each exercise description.
For this exercise, don't change the HTML code given.

<html>
	<body>
		Animals:
		<ol id="ol1">
			<li>Frog</li>
			<li>Dog</li>
			<li>Bunny</li>
		</ol>

		<div id="id1">
			<p>This is the text in div id1</p>
			<p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
		</div>

		<p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

		<div class="myClass">I love learning about HTML and JavaScript</div>

		<p class="myClass">Coding is fun</p>

		<button id="button1">Button 1</button>
		<br /><br />
		<button id="button2">Button 2</button>
	</body>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		// Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"
		let newTextExercise1 = "Here's some new text";
		document.querySelector("#id2").innerText = newTextExercise1;

		// Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
		document.querySelector("#id1").style.color = "green";
		// Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
		function logMyClass() {
			let myClass = document.querySelector(".myClass");
			console.log(myClass);
		}
		// Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
		let childrenOfId1 = document.querySelector("#id1").children;
		console.log(childrenOfId1);
		/**
		    // You do not need to put the console.log into a function like ex 3.
		    You can also add these items all one one line.
			console.log((childrenOfId1 = document.querySelector("#id1").children)); **/

		// Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
		console.log(document.querySelector("#ol1").children);

		// Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
		let childrenInList = document.querySelector("#ol1").children;
		for (let i = 1; i <= childrenInList.length; i++) {
			console.log(childrenInList.length);
		}
		// Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
		let childrenInList2 = document.querySelector("#ol1").children;
		const newNode = document.createElement("li");
		let textNode = document.createTextNode("Another One");
		newNode.appendChild(textNode);
		document.querySelector("#ol1").appendChild(newNode);

		// Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
		// an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".
		document.querySelector("#button1").addEventListener("click", function () {
			greeting();
		});
		function greeting() {
			alert("Hi, from Techtoncia");
		}

		//
		// Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
		// The document object model a representation of the current page. It is a set of types that can be used to create
		//an in memory tree data structure that mirrors the structure of your HTML. It is not your mactual HTML just a representation of it.

		// The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

		// Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
		// Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.

		// selects all class elements
		let myClassElements = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");
		console.log(myClassElements);
		// loop through each myClassn element

		// update each text with !

		// Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
		// the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100
		document.querySelector("#button2").addEventListener("click", function () {
			replacewWithRandom();
		});
		function replacewWithRandom() {
			// Will fire when button is clicked- this helps check to see if button has a working event listener
			console.log("button clicked");
			// variable for children of element id 1
			let childrenOfElementId1 = document.querySelector("#id1").children;
			// variable that holds random number
			let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
			// checks to see if the random number works and checks to see if the variable holds the children of el id1
			console.log(randomNumber, childrenOfElementId1);
			// should set the children elements to the random number - However this does not work. I am unsure of why this doesn't render on the page
			childrenOfElementId1.innerText = randomNumber;
		}

		// childrenOfElementId1.innerText = randomNumber;
		// How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
		// What references did you use to help?
		// Please put your answers in a comment below:
		// This was really fun. I haven't practiced alot with DOM manipulation so I spend a lot of time learning more about it.
		// I used W3Schools and MDN. I also used stack overflow.
